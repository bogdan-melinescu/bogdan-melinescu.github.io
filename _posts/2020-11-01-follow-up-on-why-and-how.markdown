We know the spark of all of this started ([previous blog post]({% post_url 2020-10-29-where-everything-started %}))
we are going to move on to what the plan is. Of course there are many examples of how
this spark later grows into a full blown wildfire, but for now let's focus on what I
plan to do about it. More gossip in later posts.

Now we've established that "I don't know enough", which is both true and a horrible way
to end and argument you think you're losing. The second part I can't fix, but the first
part is the whole point of the journey I'm documenting in this blog.

The road to "finding a ***better*** *way*" is starts with "finding a *way*" and that
means first having a project. Throughout the years, I've had a *lot* of projects, some
my own, some from friends, some from acquaintances, but for some reason none of them
stuck (fuel for the aforementioned gossip, later). This time I intend to keep this one
up, this one idea, this one thing that has to work out somehow.

This will either result in a better way or a hell of a lot of lesson. Let's see how fast
we get to either one of the outcomes.
