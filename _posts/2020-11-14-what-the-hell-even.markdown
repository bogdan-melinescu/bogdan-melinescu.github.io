I'm making it a point not to ret-con my blog, not to go back and correct
any of my previous posts to fix anything besides spelling mistakes. The
reason I mention this is that for those (two) who read this blog from the
beginning will be whiplashed by the tone shifts and pacing mistakes made.

I'll get a feel for the proper tone of each post, and thy way each post
relates to the previous one and the following one. Right now everything is
all over the place so I'm gonna take this opportunity to summarize what you
as a reader need to know so far.

1. After witnessing a lot of ways one can fuck up a company, I've decided
to try and start a company of my own.
2. Being a software developer, the company would naturally be a software
company.
3. In the city that I live and work in (Cluj-Napoca) there are already a
lot of out-sourcing firms, so my future company won't do that.
4. If it's not out-sourcing, then it has to be based on a product.
5. Along the way I've had a lot of potential ideas, none of them resulted
in anything more that scribbles on pages. 
6. The latest idea is a based on visualizing data in the form of lists.
7. This blog is to help document the making of this app and of this company.

Now that we are all caught up, I hope it will be easier to follow the rest
of the posts going forward.
