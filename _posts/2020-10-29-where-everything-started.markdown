Everything has to have a beginning, unfortunately it wasn't documented at the
time because the author was (and probably always will be) lazy. The summary that
I'm about to make here is very succinct and will leave out elements that are lost
in the mists of time.

As I've already mentioned in the [About](https://bogdan-melinescu.github.com/About)
page, everything started once it became clear that there were very few companies 
that were managed and lead the way I thought someone should manage/lead them. Even
among the people from my generation, once someone had even the tiniest slither of
"entrepreneurship" they immediately became, what I would describe as, an asshole.
If they would hear any criticism towards their 'asshole moves' or 'bad 
decisions', they would immediately counter with "you don't know, you're just a 
simple employee, a corporate stooge". And that would be the end of the argument
because I indeed was a 'mere' employee and:

1. it wouldn't feel right to talk about something I'm not sure of, since I do not,
in fact, hold the ultimate truth.
2. even if for some reason I did intend to correct him, it wouldn't matter since
he had already put a label on me, judging me inferior, and so voided all of my 
opinions

Note: to get things straight, being an employee is not bad, being an entrepreneur 
is not bad. This is about the people in these roles and not the roles themselves.
I have a feeling this particular example would have been an asshole regardless of 
the role.

Nevertheless, I then decided "yeah, despite being an asshole, he does have a point,
I don't know yet, cause I don't have my own company". So ever since then (about 10
years ago) I've been trying to start my own company, in an attempt to find this
"better way" that I keep talking about.

This latest iteration of the "better way" also includes a blog to preserve everything
for posterity. Maybe if (or when? :( ) things go wrong, I could maybe find out why.
