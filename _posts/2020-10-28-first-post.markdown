Ok, so I've had this Github Pages thing for a long time, since 2017 I think. Now I've finally
decided that I'm going to use it as a personal blog to keep myself acocuntable.

Now that everything is setup, with Jekyll and everything, now let's see how long this takes me.

My goal is at least two posts a month starting from November.

Wish me luck!
