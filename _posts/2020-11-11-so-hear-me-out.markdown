If you haven't had the chance to read Simon Sineks great book **Start with Why**, you
could probably make to with this short [youtube video](https://youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4). The basic
idea is this: at the heart of any endeavor you have to have a strong "why", i.e. "why do you
want to do this", "why is this so important to you".

The distilled form that Simon puts this is *"people don't buy what you do, they by why
you do it"*. So here it goes for me:

"We want to help the users tame the chaos both on the inside and on the outside." (why.) 
"We will do this by using the latest mobile technologies and top notch user interfaces ..." (how.)
"... and create an application to visualize and track the things that are most important" (what.)

OK, now I know I've lost some of you while you were reading the above, I've lost people
when "pitching" this idea live too. But I feel strongly about it and in the next couple 
of articles I'll try and figure out the reason why I feel this way.

Just to make this clearer a bit, here are a few bullet points that describe more in detail
what I want to do:
* an app that lets you create and manage lists for anything you can think of
* the main focus will be on the visualization part, being able to see the data
in different ways in order to shed new light on the it
* there is also the social aspect of sharing lists (or parts of them) with your
friends (a shared grocery list, a project todo list, a shared boardgames list, etc)
* the main interface with the user will be a mobile app, with maybe a web app for guests
* after some time there would be things like "curated lists" that are approved by
moderators and can be "borrowed" by other users of the app
* there might also be an initiative to add custom skins for different ways to 
visualize the data in some lists

All of this sounds ... not good, I agree, but let's see what it turns into along
the way. 

P.S. I've right before posting this, I've read a bit through my previous posts and
they really don't seem to connect in any way. I'll try and get better at this as I
go, bare with me.
