This is and should be described as a "lazy blog", the blog where I will try and write as often as possible
to document the journey and keep myself accountable to my goal of creating a software company. As a software
developer, I've had the chance to work in two large companies and one start-up. I've seen a lot of examples of bad managers and bad leaders, leading to poor decisions and even worse outcomes. This blog is to find a
better way.

This blog will start off small, as all things do, beginning with an idea that "there has to be a better way,
a moral way, a non-asshole way". By the end of this blog it hope all my readers (all two of them!) will be 
as convinced as me that there indeed is a better way.

Hyper-links might change. Be aware.

A few meta-data for this blog:
